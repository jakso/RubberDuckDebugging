# RubberDuckDebugging
A Windows 10 app for helping you better understand your own code

A simple, yet useful, technique for understanding problems within your code, is to explain what the code is supposed to do to someone 
else. While you carefully explain how you were thinking, and what you are trying to accomplish, you will see that some of your 
assumptions probably are wrong. When you gain this insight, it will be easy to fix the problem.

Instead of talking to a co-worker, you can instead talk to the Rubber Duck. 

This app keeps track of how many times you have consulted the Rubber Duck and how much time you have spent explaining your code.
